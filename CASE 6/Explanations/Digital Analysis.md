### Question 5: What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?

````sql
SELECT
    ROUND(100 * COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) /

(
	SELECT
		visit_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 AND page_id = 12 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS view_checkout,
        SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase

### Question 8: What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?

````sql
SELECT 
	p.product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS views,

FROM events e
JOIN page_hierarchy p
	USING (page_id)
WHERE p.product_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.product_category

### Question 9: What are the top 3 products by purchases?

````sql
WITH purchase_cte AS 
(
	SELECT 
		DISTINCT visit_id 
	FROM events 
	WHERE page_id = 13
