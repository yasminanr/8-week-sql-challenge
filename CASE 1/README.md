Danny seriously loves Japanese food, so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their **visiting patterns**, **how much money they‚Äôve spent** and also **which menu items are their favourite**. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

# Solution and Explanation

### Question 1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

````sql
SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m 
	USING (product_id)
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Use SUM ```price``` and GROUP BY to find the total amount spent by each customer (```total_spent```).
- JOIN ```sales``` and ```menu``` tables because ```customer_id``` and ```price``` columns are in different tables.

#### Output:
| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

### Question 2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

````sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT (order_date)) AS visit_count
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- Use COUNT and GROUP BY to find the the number of days each customer visits the restaurant
- Use DISTINCT ```order_date``` to find unique days. If we do not use DISTINCT, the dates may be repeated.

#### Output:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

### Question 3: What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

````sql
WITH sales_ordered AS
(
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id, 
		s.order_date, 
		m.product_name,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank_menu
	FROM sales s
	JOIN menu m
		USING (product_id)
)

SELECT 
	customer_id, 
	product_name
FROM sales_ordered
WHERE rank_menu = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a common table expression ```sales_ordered```.
- Use windows function with DENSE_RANK to create a new column ```rank_menu``` based on ```order_date```.
- GROUP BY all columns and show only the menus with rank = 1.

#### Output:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | sushi        | 
| A           | curry        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A's first orders are sushi and curry.
- Customer B's first order is curry.
- Customer C's first order is ramen.

### Question 4: What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

````sql
SELECT 
	m.product_name,
	COUNT(s.product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
	USING (product_id)
GROUP BY s.product_id, m.product_name
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

#### Steps: 
- Use COUNT ```product_id``` and GROUP BY to find how many times an item was purchased.
- ORDER BY ```purchase_count``` with descending order.
- Use LIMIT to show the most purchased item.

#### Output:
| product_name | purchase_count | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ramen      | 8   |

- Ramen is the most purchased item on the menu. It has been purchased 8 times.

### Question 5: Which item was the most popular for each customer?

````sql
WITH popular_menu AS
(
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id, 
		m.product_name, 
		COUNT(s.product_id) AS order_count,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(s.customer_id) DESC) AS rank_fav
	FROM menu m
	JOIN sales s
		USING (product_id)
	GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
)

SELECT 
	customer_id, 
	product_name, 
	order_count
FROM popular_menu
WHERE rank_fav = 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a common table expression ```popular_menu```.
- Use COUNT and GROUP BY to find the how many times an item purchased by each customer.
- Use DENSE_RANK to rank the ```order_count``` for each product by descending order for each customer.
- Show only the menus with rank_fav = 1.

#### Output:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

- Customer A and C's favourite menu is ramen.
- Customer B enjoys all items on the menu equally.

### Question 6: Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

````sql
WITH sales_member AS
(
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id, 
		m.join_date,
		s.order_date,
		s.product_id,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank_order_date
	FROM sales s
	JOIN members m
		USING (customer_id)
	WHERE s.order_date >= m.join_date
)

SELECT 
	s.customer_id, 
	s.order_date, 
	m2.product_name 
FROM sales_member s
JOIN menu m2
	USING (product_id)
WHERE rank_order_date = 1;
````

#### Steps: 
- Create a common table expression ```sales_member```.
- Use DENSE_RANK to rank the orders partitioning by ```customer_id``` with ascending ```order_date```.
- Filter ```order_date``` to be on or after ```join_date``` using WHERE clause.
- Filter table by rank = 1 to show 1st item purchased by each customer.

#### Output:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-07 | curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-11 | sushi        |

- Customer A's first order after becoming a member is curry.
- Customer B's first order after becoming a member is sushi.

### Question 7: Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

````sql
WITH sales_prior_member AS
(
	SELECT 
		s.customer_id, 
		m.join_date,
		s.order_date,
		s.product_id,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rank_order_date
	FROM sales s
	JOIN members m
		USING (customer_id)
	WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
)

SELECT 
	s.customer_id, 
	s.order_date, 
	m2.product_name 
FROM sales_prior_member s
JOIN menu m2
	USING (product_id)
WHERE rank_order_date = 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a common table expression ```sales_prior_member```.
- Use DENSE_RANK to rank the orders partitioning by ```customer_id``` with descending ```order_date```.
- Filter ```order_date``` to be before ```join_date``` using WHERE clause.
- Filter table by rank = 1 to show last item purchased by each customer just before they became a member.

#### Output:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-01 |  sushi        |
| A           | 2021-01-01 |  curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-04 |  sushi        |

- Customer A‚Äôs last orders before becoming a member are sushi and curry.
- Customer B‚Äôs last order before becoming a member is sushi.

### Question 8: What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

````sql
SELECT 
	s.customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT (s.product_id)) AS unique_menu,
    SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
	USING (product_id)
JOIN members m2
	USING (customer_id)
WHERE s.order_date < m2.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

#### Steps: 
- Use COUNT, SUM and GROUP BY to find the total unique items and total amount spent by each customer.
- JOIN ```sales```, ```menu``` and ```members``` tables because the required columns are in different tables.
- Filter ```order_date``` to be before ```join_date``` using WHERE clause.

#### Output:
| customer_id | unique_menu | total_spent |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 2 |  40       |

- Customer A purchased 2 items for $25.
- Customer B purchased 2 items for $40.

### Question 9: If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

````sql
WITH reward_points AS 
(
	SELECT 
		*, 
        CASE WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN price * 20
        ELSE price * 10 END AS points
	FROM menu
)

SELECT 
	s.customer_id,
    SUM(r.points) AS total_points
FROM reward_points r
JOIN sales s
	USING (product_id)
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

#### Steps: 
- Each $1 spent = 10 points, but sushi gets 2x points, meaning each $1 spent = 20 points.
- Create a common table expression ```reward_points```.
- Use CASE WHEN to create conditional statements with ```product_name``` as the condition. 
- Sum all points for each customer. 

#### Output:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

- Total points for Customer A is 860.
- Total points for Customer B is 940.
- Total points for Customer C is 360.

### Question 10: In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
#### 1. Find member validity date of each customer and get last date of January
#### 2. Use CASE WHEN to allocate points by date and product id
#### 3. SUM price and points

````sql
WITH date_validity AS
(
	SELECT
		*,
        DATE_ADD(join_date, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AS valid_date,
        LAST_DAY('2021-01-31') AS last_date
	FROM members
)

SELECT 
	d.customer_id,
    d.join_date,
    d.valid_date,
    d.last_date,
    SUM(
		CASE WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
        WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN d.join_date AND d.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
        ELSE 10 * m.price END
	) AS points
FROM date_validity d
JOIN sales s
	USING (customer_id)
JOIN menu m
	USING (product_id)
WHERE s.order_date < d.last_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id;
````

#### Steps:
- In ```date_validity```, find out customer‚Äôs valid_date (which is 6 days after join_date and inclusive of join_date) and last_day of Jan 2021 (which is ‚Äò2021‚Äì01‚Äì31‚Äô).
- On Day -X to Day 1 (customer becomes member on Day 1 join_date), each $1 spent is 10 points and for sushi, each $1 spent is 20 points.
- On Day 1 join_date to Day 7 valid_date, each $1 spent for all items is 20 points.
- On Day 8 to last_day of Jan 2021, each $1 spent is 10 points and sushi is 2x points.
- Use CASE WHEN to create conditional statements with ```product_name``` as the condition.
- Use the WHERE clause to only get the points customers have at the end of January.

#### Output:
| customer_id | join_date  | valid_date  | last_date  | points |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------ |----------- |--------|
| A           | 2021-01-07 | 2021-01-13  | 2021-01-31 | 1370   |
| B           | 2021-01-09 | 2021-01-15  | 2021-01-31 | 820    |

- Total points for Customer A is 1,370.
- Total points for Customer B is 820.

#### Join all the things (create one table with: customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member (Y/N))

````sql
SELECT 
	s.customer_id,
    s.order_date, 
    m.product_name,
    m.price,
    CASE WHEN s.order_date < m2.join_date THEN 'N'
    WHEN s.order_date >= m2.join_date THEN 'Y'

FROM sales s
JOIN menu m
	USING (product_id)
LEFT JOIN members m2
	USING (customer_id)

### BONUS QUESTION
#### Rank all the things (create one table with: customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member (Y/N), ranking(null/123))
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

````sql
